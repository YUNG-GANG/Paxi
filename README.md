# Paxi
Minecraft mod for automatic global data pack loading

The first time you run Paxi, the `paxi` folder will be created in your Minecraft config directory, along with relevant subdirectories for data and resource packs.

See the [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/paxi) post for supported versions and complete instructions.
