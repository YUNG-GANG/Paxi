# Paxi 1.17 

Minecraft mod for automatic global data pack loading

The first time you run Paxi, the paxi folder will be created in your Minecraft config directory. Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play. Both zip files and regular folders (containing a pack.mcmeta file) are supported.

See the CurseForge post for supported versions and releases.
